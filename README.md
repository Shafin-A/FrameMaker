# FrameMaker
Extracts unique image frames from a video, and deletes most duplicates. Uses OpenCV and SSIM(Structural Similarity Index)

To use, install Python 3(https://www.python.org/downloads/), OpenCV for python(pip install opencv-python) and SSIM(pip install --upgrade scikit-image).

RunFrameMaker.py and enter the name of the video file. Make sure both are in the same directory.
